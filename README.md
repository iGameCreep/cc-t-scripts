# GameCreep35 | CC:T Programs

You will find here the programs I use with the Minecraft mod CC:Tweaked. These are made for my use, so I won't offer any support with them.

## Induction Matrix

Scripts originate from [Wolfe_br](https://pastebin.com/u/wolfe_br): [Matrix Manager](https://pastebin.com/LMdUZY4Z) and it's [Receiver Module](https://pastebin.com/3naSaR8X)

### Setup

- Computer 1 placed next to an induction port, either use screen or place an Ender Modem.
- Computer 2 (optional) placed where you want with a screen (6x2 recommended) with an Ender Modem.

### Installation

- Computer 1: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iGameCreep/cc-t-scripts/master/induction_matrix/matrix.lua`, then `matrix install`. After that, use `matrix` to start.
- Computer 2: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iGameCreep/cc-t-scripts/master/induction_matrix/receiver.lua`, then `receiver install`. After that, use `receiver` to start.

## YouCube

All scripts are from the official [YouCube's GitHub page](https://github.com/CC-YouCube/), repository [client](https://github.com/CC-YouCube/client). I only modified a few files to make some slight changes, like implementing my own server directly or redirect to monitor directly.

### Setup

- Place one computer with next to it a speaker and a screen (pretty much any size).

### Installation

- Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iGameCreep/cc-t-scripts/master/youcube-client/installer.lua`, then `installer`. After that, use `youcube` to start the client.

## Music Steamer

Just relying on the already-made script for this one. Link [here](https://github.com/terreng/computercraft-streaming-music)

## Setup

- Craft a `Advanced Noisy Pocket Computer`.

### Installation

- Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terreng/computercraft-streaming-music/main/music.lua`. After that, start it with `music`. That's all.
